# Floyd-s-Algorithm
Randomly create an undirected complete graph as follows:
• Create n vertices where n is randomly selected between 5 and 10. Display the
selected n value.
• Create an n x n adjacency matrix A. Randomly assign a weight to each edge (i,j) where 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n. Specifically, make A[i,j] = 0 if i = j. If i ≠ j, assign an integer randomly selected between 1 and 10 to A[i,j]. Ensure that A[i,j] = A[j,i] since you need to create an undirected graph. Display the generated adjacency matrix.


For the created undirected complete graph, write a program to find all pairs shortest paths using Floyd’s algorithm. Print all pairs shortest paths and their lengths
